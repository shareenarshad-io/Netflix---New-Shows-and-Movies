# Netflix---New-Shows-and-Movies
Data Project Using Netflix Data

The project utilizes Netflix's data in order to analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries. 

 The netflix_data.csv file consists of a list of all the TV shows/movies available on Netflix. A netflix.py file contains the Python code written. There are questions answered for full analysis on what type of shows to produce and how to grow the business. Each recommendation is backed by data. Recommendations are intended for business executives and focused on increasing revenue.
